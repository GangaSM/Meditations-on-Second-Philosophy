Hi, I'm Ganga and I hope this blog can be a creative outlet where I consolidate and share ideas within physics and philosophy :) By training I am a theoretical physicist and I carry that style of thinking in all aspects of inquiry. I lack the patience to do mathematics as a mathematician and lack the experience to do philosophy as a philosopher, but that isn’t neccessarily a bad thing. I completed my Bachelors and Masters at Imperial and am now wandering aimlessly for a bit. For more see [CV]({{ '/assets/CV.pdf' | relative_url }}). This blog is named after Descartes’ Meditations on First Philosophy and the colour scheme is inspired by the Leviathan, which was a raid in Destiny 2
