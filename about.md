Hi, I'm Ganga. I hope this blog will be a creative outlet where I consolidate and share ideas within physics and philosophy :)
I completed my Bachelors and Masters in Theoretical Physics at Imperial College London and am now wandering aimlessly for a bit



Future Post Topics
- Why should a theory of everything exist?
- The unreasonable effectiveness of quantisation
- Emergence Phenomena
- Cosmological phase transitions - Cosmic strings and topological defects
- Weak time travel - How FTL signalling can (kind-of) change the past
- Newtonian gravity - From geometry
- Humans, Birds, and Compactification
- A guide to misleading statistics



The blog colour scheme is inspired by the Leviathan, which was a raid in Destiny 2
