Submission to SoME 2025.
There is a problem with most resources on the internet explaining ideas around black holes. The problem is that black holes are generally spoken about as local astrophysical phenomena and they are so much more than that. This article will move past discussions on formation and local phenomenology and try to impress on the reader a global understanding of a black hole - A universe with a black hole is fundamentally different to a universe without one.

Behold! This is a black hole (from a global perspective). It is a very formal statement which effectively says
> A black hole is a causally disconnected region of spacetime

This article will break that very formal statement down across - different chapters each explaining an aspect of this statement. By the end you should have a complete picture of what this statement is saying.

I wont have to make reference to specific types of black holes (solutions to Einsteins equations) because they should all obey this condition. After that we will explain some of the global results of this. The article will end with an essay by Laplace who discussed black holes in an elegant way over 300 years ago

### Spacetime

Future null infinity


LIGHT gets pulled back due to curvature

### Causality

Light can transmits signals between places and this transmission is what causes things to happen.

Wiggle a magnet, the EM force transmits that force to CAUSE another magnet to wiggle outside.

The speed limit of the universe is c

If a magnet is inside a black hole then no matter what I do to it, it can never cause anything to happen to a magnet outside the black hole

A black hole is a region of the universe where once I go in I cant come back out by travelling faster than c

We cut the universe in two parts. In one part, things can influence each other and in the other half they cant. This causal connection only goes one way and that is the black hole. 

### Horizon


### Singularity

From what weve discussed it seems that a black holes doesn't necessarily clothe a singularity, and that would be correct. A black hole doesn't require a singularity. But in most solutions we look at there is a singularity. A singularity is a defect in spacetime. Its where the curvature blows up or more fundamentally, where *insert singularity theorem here

### Laplace

I want to end with a short discussion about an essay written by Pierre Simon Laplace over 200 years ago. At the time Newtons theory of Gravity prevailed, but with a corpuscular theory of light, Newtonian gravity still predicted a bending of light in a gravitational field. Laplace then imagine a star so great that its gravitational field would stop its light from ever leaving, a dark star.
