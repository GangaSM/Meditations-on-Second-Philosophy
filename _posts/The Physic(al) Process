Physics is a very practical pursuit. We want to understand how the universe works. More specifically we want to know the set of rules which that everything in the universe follows. Ideally we would want to describe the universe in as few rules as possible. To start then, we guess some rules (say…) based on our intuition and we write them down on a piece of paper. These rules are written down in the language of mathematics. We then check what physical phenomena this set of rules describes. We have successfully described the job of theoretical physics. Now we have to check that the universe actually obeys these rules, and so we go out and we check what actually happens and compare to what the rules we wrote down predicted. If theres a discrepancy then we know the rules we wrote down were slightly wrong and we go back to adjust them. This is the role of the experimental physicist. This back and forth is the process by which physics happens and it leads us to a set of rules than encompasses more and more physical phenomena accurately. The aim is to have one set of rules describe everything. We dont have that yet but we’re working towards it.

A lot of the time this involves symmetries. They are fundamental.
